                        <article><p>I have been working as a sound engineer for over 12 years. I started simply by recording and editing my own voiceovers, and now I have produced TV commercials, movie trailers, video games, and more.</p>
                            <p>One of the things I like most about sound engineering is that it combines both artistic and technical requirements. In terms of software, it is necessary to be skilled, but as a consumer of software, not as a creator, and that is the biggest deficiency for me. In terms of hardware, I love machines, in addition to the many possibilities for modding, vintage markets, or technological novelties.</p>

                        <article><p>All my life I have been involved with music. I studied piano and singing, and participated in various African percussion bands.</p>
                            <p>From all of that experience, I took advantage of the knowledge of rhythm, voice technique (breathing, intonation, cadence...) for a new passion: voiceover and dubbing.</p>
                            <p>After many years, I managed to establish myself in the market, but recent changes in the industry and, above all, the emergence of AI for voice generation, have caused the volume of work to plummet.</p>

                            <article><p>As an IT professional, I worked as a project manager in software development companies for 7 years. However, I didn't get to develop my technical skills due to my PM role, and ended up doing sales tasks.</p>
                                <p>It was not at all what I wanted, so I decided to take a chance and switch careers, focusing on sound engineering and voiceover work. During these years, I have continued to program, but only for personal and small projects, such as everything related to 3D printing, my CRM, or Arduino projects.</p>
                                <p>For these reasons, I would like to return to programming, and although I do not rule out PM tasks, I would love to develop my more technical skills.</p></article>

                        <article><p>I love tinkering with both hardware and software. My heroes are people like James Bruton, Ivan Miranda, Ray Billings, Adam Savage, the guy from the Wintergatan Channel (yes, I'm checking my YouTube subscriptions), and My Mechanics.</p>
                            <p>While I feel confident following instructions for software-related projects, I struggle to create things from scratch. I believe that pursuing a career as a web developer will help me get back on track with software development, not just as a spectator but as a creator.</p>

                    <div class="grid-item item1"><p>My first workshop. I was young and inexperienced. So naive.</p><p>It was a bit scary to start coding again. Just installing the tools created the anticipation about something important was going to happen, I was joining the IT family again.</p>

                    <div class="grid-item item4"><p>In this workshop I discovered the Flex Container, such a great tool to display stuff, I decided to go for a nested structure of Flex Container. I dedicated a ridiculous amount of time on this but I got some knowledge for future projects.</p>
                        <p>I also went deeper in the use of Source Control using Git. It still feels like some kind of magic.</p>
                        <p>On this workshop I also had the opportunity to work a bit more with JavaScript functions.</p>

                    <div class="grid-item item1"><p>This one was hard. Working with objects was very tricky, even when I am supposed to have the mindset from studying IT engineering a very long time ago.</p>
                        <p>The resources were interesting, but I didn't need most of them for this workshop. With more time I could add more functionalities like deleting or modifying an existing movie.</p>

                    <div class="grid-item item4"><p>And finally this leads us to this same workshop. I must confess that I spent a huge amount of time on the design, both for the desktop and the mobile versions, it can be a rabbithole.</p>
                        <p>I think that the use of the flex containers and event listeners is much more refined here than in previous workshops.</p>

                            <p>The picture shows the mobile version, which implements the classic game of Hangman. It took some effort to make everything fit well, but the end result was worth it.</p>
                            <p>For this project, I separated the data and logic into different files and tried to keep the logic as simple as possible. However, some decisions made at the beginning carried over into later stages. If I were starting from scratch, I would do a few things differently, but to be fair, I didn't know how the final project would turn out when I began.</p>
